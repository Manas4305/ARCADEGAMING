Abstraction for ARCADE GAMING:
Introduction:
Arcade games have been a popular form of entertainment for decades, captivating players with their engaging gameplay and immersive experiences. This report presents a C++ implementation of an arcade gaming code, showcasing key features and techniques used to develop a simple yet interactive game.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create an arcade game using C++ that demonstrates fundamental game development concepts such as graphics rendering, user input handling, collision detection, and scoring.

Game Description:
The arcade game developed for this project is a classic space shooter, where the player controls a spaceship and must shoot down enemy ships while avoiding their projectiles. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, with the player's spaceship and enemy ships represented as characters. The player moves the spaceship horizontally using arrow keys and shoots projectiles using the spacebar.

C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. 
The features or libraries used in the program are: 
1.)	OBJECT  ORIENTED PROGRAMMING: CLASSES.
2.)	INHERITENCE CLASS.
3.)	CONDITIONAL  STATEMENTS.
4.)	SWITCH FUNCTIONS.
5.)	EXPECTION HANDLING
6.)	USER-DEFINED FUNCTION.
